# Terminal-Breakout

If your terminal has python you can play breakout entirely in it.

## Currently it only draws the blocks, ball, and paddle.

TODO list:
- Create a velocity system for the ball
- Implement a collision system between the ball and blocks + ball and screen sides
- Implement a loss system - default the loss to shutting down the game for now
- Ensure that any unexpected exits do not leave the curses library in an awkward state causing the user to have to "reset" their terminal
- Implement colour for the ball + blocks
