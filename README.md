# Terminal-Breakout

If your terminal has python you can play breakout entirely in it.

## Currently it only draws the blocks, ball, and paddle.

TODO list:
✔️ Create a velocity system for the ball
✔️  Implement a collision system between the ball and screen sides
❌ Implement a collision system between the ball and blocks (currently it is quite buggy and does not flag active status correctly)
❌ Implement a loss system - default the loss to shutting down the game for now
❌ Implement "sides" of the paddle to change the angle
❌ Implement a power-up system
❌ Ensure that any unexpected exits do not leave the curses library in an awkward state causing the user to have to "reset" their terminal
❌ Implement colour for the ball + blocks
